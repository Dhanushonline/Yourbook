        <h4>THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A F*CK</h4>
        <p>The mega bestseller. The self-help book for people who hate self-help books. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is all about self-improvement not through avoiding problems or always being happy, but rather through improving upon problems and learning to accept the occasional unhappiness. It’s a radical departure from anything else you’ve ever read, and that’s what makes it so powerful.</p>

        <h4>EVERYTHING IS F*CKED: A BOOK ABOUT HOPE</h4>
        <p>In Everything Is F*cked, I turn my gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing on mountains of psychological research, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato and Nietzsche, I dissect religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another.</p>

        <h4>WILL</h4>
        <p>Will Smith, one of the most globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully in a brave and inspiring book, co-authored by me, that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection align. This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. The story of how one exceptional man mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same.</p>
